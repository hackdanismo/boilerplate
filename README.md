+ [Install](#install)

## Clone the Repository
It is recommended to clone to repository using the `SSH (Secure Shell)` protocol. This can be done using the terminal. `SSH` will need to be setup first.

```shell
$ git@github.com:hackdanismo/boilerplate.git
```

## Install
Once the repository has been cloned, any dependencies or packages will need to be installed. These will be listed in the `package.json` file.

```shell
$ cd boilerplate
$ npm install
```

It is worth also setting the recommended `Node` version. The `.nvmrc` configuration file sets the recommended `Node` version. `Node Version Manager (NVM)` needs to be installed. To apply the correct `Node` version:

```shell
$ nvm use
```
